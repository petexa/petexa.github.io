        "from": "**Description:**  \nDumbbell & Run is a full-body, high-intensity AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) workout performed in 17 minutes. Athletes alternate between dumbbell or kettlebell strength movements—such as cleans, snatches, or thrusters—and running intervals (e.g., 200-400m). The goal is to complete as many rounds and reps as possible within the time cap, pushing both muscle endurance and cardiovascular capacity.\n\n**CoachNotes:**  \n- Choose a dumbbell or kettlebell weight that allows you to maintain good form without excessive rest.   \n- Pace the runs to keep transitions smooth—avoid an all-out sprint that may spike your heart rate too early.  \n- Focus on quality reps: maintain a neutral spine and controlled tempo during lifts.  \n- Break up reps proactively to avoid burnout, especially in later rounds.  \n- Stay consistent—steady effort beats starting too fast and fading.  \n- Prioritize safe movement patterns and listen to your body.",
