Build a mobile-first website for my gym community called "Iron & Ale".
Purpose: list all upcoming events so members never forget.
Design: neon-inspired theme with glowing navigation and hero banner tagline 
"Sets and Reps. Cheers and Beers. That's the Program."
Pages: Home, Events, Past Events.
Events: read from /events/events.json. Render event cards with name, date, image, description, and location.
Buttons: show conditionally based on JSON flags (More Info, Book Now, Remind Me).
Past Events: auto-archive events where date < now, styled with faded neon.
Footer: include community contact info.
Ensure mobile-first responsive design and GitHub Pages compatibility.
Ignore the /backup folder completely. Do not scaffold, edit, or deploy any files inside it.
