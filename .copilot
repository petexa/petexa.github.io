- Add explanatory comments for each major section of code.
- Suggest safe defaults before advanced options.
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Avoid overly complex patterns unless explicitly requested.
- When generating HTML/CSS/JS, explain what each block does in comments.
- When suggesting improvements, explain why the change is needed.
- Keep code modular and easy to test incrementally.
