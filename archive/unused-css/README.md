# Archived CSS Files

This folder is for archiving CSS files that are no longer part of the main theme system.

## Note about style.css
The `assets/css/style.css` file is still used by `utilities.html` which has legacy neon styling.
When `utilities.html` is migrated to the new theme system, `style.css` can be archived here.

## Current CSS Structure
See `assets/css/` for the new modular CSS system:
- variables.css - Theme tokens
- theme.css - Base styles
- utilities.css - Utility classes
- components.css - Component styles
